  Factorial definition:
  - The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
  - 0! is defined as 1.
  - Example: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
  CLI Requirements:
  - Should accept one integer argument.
  - Should print an error message for negative inputs or non-integer inputs.
  - Should print the calculated factorial for valid inputs.
