description: Using the gemini api, write a chat tool that allow you to interface and chat with gemini pro. It should always get the latest list of models and choose the latest. It should store your conversations, and every couple of minutes summarize the history as to reduce context length. It should be written in python and will be written with a target of docker. The chat interface should use the streaming API. You should be able to enter your API key in the interface and choose your model as well as any other parameters google lets you choose via the API. This should be a desktop app using a beautiful, modern, dark theme. It should have a multi-modal framework such that one can attach pictures or files, use the video camera, or use the microphone. Using the various real time APIs, a chat button should allow one to start a real time 'video' or 'audio' chat. The interface should allow you to select what type of interaction you want (normal vs 'real time'). Real time should allow you to start, stop, pause, select/deselect video and audio. The primary target is linux and should also work in macos if possible. The app should have a clean, neat interface using normal desktop design guidelines and be formatted as if it was for github.
